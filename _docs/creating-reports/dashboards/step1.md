* *Name*: the name of the dashboard. Although you can go to another next step without entering a valid name, you cannot click Finish to save the dashboard.

* *Comments*: any comments entered here appear in the Information window for the dashboard in the [Reports Explorer]({% link _docs/creating-reports/reports-explorer.md %}). You can expand the text area for entering comments by dragging the handle in the lower-right corner of the area.

* *Tags*: the tags for the dashboard. Click in the Tags area to display a drop-down list of tag names. Select one from the list to add that tag to the dashboard. To remove a tag, click the "x" to the left of its name. You can add as many tags as you wish to a dashboard.

* *Legacy dashboard*: In older versions, a dashboard displayed existing reports with the same layout in a grid. If you wish to use the older style of dashboard, turn this option on.
