> [!Note]
> A compact theme allows you to fit more elements within a web page. Note that compact themes affect only specific dashboard items such as:
>
> * [Grid](../../web-dashboard-viewer-mode/dashboard-items/grid.md)
> * [Pivot](../../web-dashboard-viewer-mode\dashboard-items\pivot.md)
> * [Filter Elements](../../\web-dashboard-viewer-mode\dashboard-items\filter-elements.md)
