# Save a Dashboard
The Web Dashboard provides the capability to save your dashboard design (dashboard items, data binding and layout settings, etc.).

* You can save the dashboard design once finished with customization. For this, open the [dashboard menu]({% link _docs/dashboard-designer/ui-elements/dashboard-menu.md %}) and click **Save**.
