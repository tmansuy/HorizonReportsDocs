# Dashboard Layout

This section describes the features related to the dashboard layout.

## Dashboard Width and Height

The control automatically stretches or shrinks content (dashboard items) in a dashboard to fit available screen space horizontally and vertically. You can adjust layout options and specify exact content width and height.

As an alternative, you can set content size in pixels. If the width or height is too large, the Dashboard control displays a scrollbar.
