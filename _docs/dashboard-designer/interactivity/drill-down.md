# Drill-Down
Dashboard provides the **Drill-Down** feature, which allows you to change the detail level of data displayed in a dashboard item. Drill-Down enables users to drill down to display detail data, or drill up to view more general information.

## Enable Drill-Down
Drill-down requires that the data section contains several dimensions...

... or a hierarchy data item (in OLAP mode).

To be able to change the detail level of data, go to the dashboard item's **Interactivity** menu and enable the **Drill Down** option.
