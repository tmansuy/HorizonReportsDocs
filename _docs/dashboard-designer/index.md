# Dashboard Designer
When adding reports to a dashboard, default layouts are chosen depending on the report type. Quick reports are displayed with a data grid, crosstabs with a pivot grid, and charts are displayed with a pie diagram. You can use the dashboard designer tool to further customize the dashboard layout.
