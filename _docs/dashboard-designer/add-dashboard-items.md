# Add Dashboard Items
You can add **dashboard items** to display visual or textual information in a dashboard.

To create a dashboard item, click the corresponding button in the [Toolbox]({% link _docs/dashboard-designer/ui-elements/toolbox.md %}) or drag an item from the Toolbox into the dashboard surface.

This creates an empty dashboard item, which you can now configure.

To completely design a dashboard item, perform the following steps.
* [Bind]({% link _docs/dashboard-designer/bind-dashboard-items-to-data/index.md %}) the dashboard item to data.
* Set specific dashboard item settings based on its type. To learn more, see [Dashboard Item Settings]({% link _docs/dashboard-designer/dashboard-item-settings/index.md %}).
* Perform the required [data shaping]({% link _docs/dashboard-designer/data-shaping/index.md %}) operations (such as [grouping]({% link _docs/dashboard-designer/data-shaping/grouping.md %}), [sorting]({% link _docs/dashboard-designer/data-shaping/sorting.md %}), [filtering]({% link _docs/dashboard-designer/data-shaping/filtering.md %}), etc.).
* Use the [interactivity]({% link _docs/dashboard-designer/interactivity/index.md %}) features to enable interaction between various dashboard items.
* Adjust the dashboard item's position and size (a [layout]({% link _docs/dashboard-designer/dashboard-layout/index.md %})) and specify the dashboard item caption settings.

To remove the dashboard item from the dashboard surface, use the **Delete** button in the [dashboard item menu]({% link _docs/dashboard-designer/ui-elements/dashboard-item-menu.md %}).
