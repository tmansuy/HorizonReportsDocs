{{ site.app_name }} updates and technical support are only available for those who have current software maintenance. When you first purchase {{ site.app_name }}, you receive one year of software maintenance. After that period, you can renew your software maintenance for one or more years at a time. While your software maintenance is current, you may install updates to the program and contact us for technical support. If your software maintenance lapses, you can no longer install updated versions and are not eligible for technical support until you renew your software maintenance. The About dialog in the Help menu displays the software maintenance expiry date.
